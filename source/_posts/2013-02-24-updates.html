<p>Since November 2010, Team POPONG has went through a variety of discussions and experiments.<br/>

Inspired by <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/blog/2013/02/09/winter-2013-updates-1/" target="_blank">GovTrack&#8217;s periodical reports</a>, we now plan to share our day-by-day lessons. We hope they would benefit other toddler teams that are imagining their own services.</p>

<h3>Politician Dictionary</h3>



<ul><li>Dropped usage of MongoDB, and migrated to SQLAlchemy+PostgreSQL.



<ul><li>Detailed backgrounds shall be posted in the future.</li>

</ul></li>

<li><p>Created portable widgets for a politician&#8217;s <strong>timeline</strong> and <strong>related people</strong>.</p>



<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://popong.com/widgets/relation.js?person_id=195224" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
