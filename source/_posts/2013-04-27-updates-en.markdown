* Search by political party affiliation (More search options available soon!)
* Autocomplete([typeahead](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/)) in search box
* Add feature to save favorite politicians to cart
* Display more personal information of politicians
    * district, job, education, experience, address
* Improve transliteration using [Unidecode](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode)
* Test GIN(Generalized Inverted Index) index + trigram module: sequential search was faster because the dataset is too small
