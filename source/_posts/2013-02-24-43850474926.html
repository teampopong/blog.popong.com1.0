title: Updates (Jan., Feb. 2013)
---

<p>Since November 2010, Team POPONG has went through a variety of discussions and experiments.<br/>

Inspired by <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/blog/2013/02/09/winter-2013-updates-1/" target="_blank">GovTrack&#8217;s periodical reports</a>, we now plan to share our day-by-day lessons. We hope they would benefit other toddler teams that are imagining their own services.</p>



<h3>Politician Dictionary</h3>



<ul><li>Dropped usage of MongoDB, and migrated to SQLAlchemy+PostgreSQL.



<ul><li>Detailed backgrounds shall be posted in the future.</li>

</ul></li>

<li><p>Created portable widgets for a politician&#8217;s <strong>timeline</strong> and <strong>related people</strong>.</p>



<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://popong.com/widgets/relation.js?person_id=195224" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

</code></pre></li>

<li>Exposed politicians&#8217; Chinese names along with the Korean names.</li>

<li>Added birthyear page (ex: <a href="http://popong.com/polidic/year/1953" target="_blank">Politicians born in 1953</a>).</li>

<li>Modified the browser title, so that the more importation information came first.



<ul><li><code>POPONG Politician Dictionary - Chin Seon-mi</code> <br/>-&gt; <code>Chin Seon-mi (Minjut-Onghap Party) :: POPONG Politician Dictionary</code></li>

</ul></li>

<li>Started accumulating visiting logs.</li>

</ul><h3>Data</h3>



<ul><li>Collected all datasets dispersed among the whole filesystem into a single Git repository.



<ul><li>Documented known sources for every dataset.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Imported Twitter, Facebook addresses of politicians 



<ul><li>From <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao-novvdf79gdExCbW9FVWg0VlBoanNQSzV1akFJR1E" target="_blank">SNS addressbook of politicians (unofficial)</a> by <a href="http://maplestory.com" target="_blank">@mazefind</a>.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Built a glossary of terms containing Korean meanings, English translations, and aliases.</li>

<li>Built a mapping between Hanja(Chinese)-Hangul(Korean) for transliterations.



<ul><li>Both for Korean last names and for general use.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Wrote a PDF-parsing library in Jython. 



<ul><li>However, produces errors and does not yet work perfectly.</li>

<li>ex: &#8220;대안&#8221; →  &#8220;눀안&#8221;</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Crawled the number of Google search results of each politician in order to digitize the politician&#8217;s popularity.



<ul><li>ex: &#8220;<em>About 24,900,000 results (0.13 seconds)</em>&#8221;</li>

<li>However, this approach was deprecated.</li>

<li>Alternatives exists: Twitter search index or co-authorships of bills.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Gathered and preprocessed <a href="https://github.com/teampopong/southkorea-maps" target="_blank">South Korean map data</a>.</li>

</ul>
